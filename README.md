# Cursor-Tracking Eyes
Tracking of mouse cursor to update virtual eyes

![Screenshot of eyes looking down and right](demo.png)

## Description of the project
Collects mouse cursor position each time the cursor is moved and updates the location of "pupils" of two eyes to look toward the cursor. Uses CSS primitive objects to form the rudimentary shapes and then Javascript to control their motion

## How to Run
Download all files then open index.html in your browser

## Roadmap of future improvements
Nice next steps include:

- Compensating for the width between the eyes (left and right should point slightly different)

- Creating eactions to unusual user events (make the eyes "dizzy" after moving circles

- Allowing the user to change the color of the eyes/face
