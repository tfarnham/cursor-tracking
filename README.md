# Cursor-Tracking Eyes
Tracking of mouse cursor to update virtual eyes

![Screenshot of eyes looking down and right](demo.png)

## Description of the project
Collects mouse cursor position each time the cursor is moved and updates the location of "pupils" of two eyes to look toward the cursor

## How to Run
Download all files then open index.html in your browser

## Roadmap of future improvements
Compensate for the width between the eyes (left and right should point slightly different)

Reactions to unusual user events (make the eyes "dizzy" after moving circles
